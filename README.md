# Kelvin Weather

This program is a temperature conversion utility that calculates and displays temperatures in different units based on a given Kelvin temperature.

The program takes a constant Kelvin temperature and converts it into Celsius, Fahrenheit and Newton scales. It will then output the results. 

It also rounds down the Fahrenheit and Newton values using the *Math.floor()* method for simplicity.
